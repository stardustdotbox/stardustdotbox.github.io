## How to clear the Soneium Score Season 6 campaign

Soneium Score Season 6 has started ヽ(´ー`)ノ  
Soneium Score is an activity scoring system on Soneium where you can earn a badge by reaching a score of 80 or higher.  
You can improve your score by generating unique transactions, providing LP, using lending, contributing TVL to vaults, and so on. However, to efficiently optimize your Soneium Score, it’s best to prioritize and clear the seasonal campaigns one by one.

### Campaign 1

Period: Jan 15 - Feb 12, 07:00 - 07:00 (UTC)

<img width="704" height="308" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bbc5693-d0f0-4071-b933-9b6470619e50" />

<img width="367" height="464" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8690784-d267-4309-886b-c5f428474444" />

Access <https://www.harkan.io/>, create an account, and spin the Cyber Wheel of Fortune 10 times to complete the task.  
However, you can only spin it 5 times per day, so it will take at least 2 days.

### Campaign 2

Period: Jan 15 - Feb 12, 07:00 - 07:00 (UTC)

<img width="699" height="313" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95d1a291-4258-46fa-9b04-a4c253f9c4aa" />

<img width="348" height="343" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2625e9f-7fe2-47da-9eaa-838f6b6e2e74" />

<img width="305" height="56" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/623338d3-c1b7-42fa-8f5d-7a3da6d1f3b6" />

When you access <https://surflayer.xyz/?lootbox=1868>, a popup related to a Loot Box will appear.  
If you open this 10 times, Campaign 2 will be completed. However, it seems you can only open 5 boxes per day, so it will take at least 2 days.  
By the way, the cost to open one box is 0.000004 ETH (about 20 JPY).

### Campaign 3

Period: Jan 15 - Feb 12, 07:00 - 07:00 (UTC)

<img width="700" height="315" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6216c439-b069-40ee-a37e-dc0bb3e9712b" />

The task is to execute 20 transactions on <https://velodrome.finance/>.  
Each swap creates 2 transactions, so I completed the task by swapping 0.0001 USDCE to ETH 10 times. （ ´ー｀）y―┛~~

### Campaign 4

Period: Jan 15 - Feb 12, 07:00 - 07:00 (UTC)

<img width="705" height="320" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30981e0f-536d-4b10-b778-e0ef13a0fb58" />

<img width="535" height="552" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae983987-526b-4b16-9289-3c440319ec39" />

I completed this task by accessing <https://wowmax.exchange/> and swapping 0.0001 USDCE to ETH 10 times. ヽ(´ー`)ノ

### If your score is still not enough

If your score is still short, generate more transactions through on-chain GM, Ruby Score voting, and daily tasks to push your score above 80 and get the badge. （ ´ー｀）y―┛~~
