## How to Clear the Soneium Score Season 6 Campaign

Soneium Score Season 6 has started ヽ(´ー`)ノ  
Soneium Score is a scoring system that measures your on-chain activity within Soneium, and you can earn a badge once your score exceeds 80.

To increase your score, you can generate unique transactions, provide LP, use lending or vaults to contribute to TVL, and more.  
However, if you want to efficiently optimize your Soneium Score, the best way is to focus on the seasonal campaigns first and clear them in order.

### Campaign 1

Period: Jan 15 - Feb 12, 07:00 - 07:00 (UTC)

<img width="704" height="308" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bbc5693-d0f0-4071-b933-9b6470619e50" />

<img width="367" height="464" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8690784-d267-4309-886b-c5f428474444" />

Go to <https://www.harkan.io/>, create an account, and spin the Cyber Wheel of Fortune 10 times to complete this task.  
You can only spin 5 times per day, so it will take at least 2 days.

### Campaign 2

Period: Jan 15 - Feb 12, 07:00 - 07:00 (UTC)

<img width="699" height="313" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95d1a291-4258-46fa-9b04-a4c253f9c4aa" />

<img width="348" height="343" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2625e9f-7fe2-47da-9eaa-838f6b6e2e74" />

<img width="305" height="56" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/623338d3-c1b7-42fa-8f5d-7a3da6d1f3b6" />

When you visit <https://surflayer.xyz/?lootbox=1868>, a popup related to the Loot Box will appear.  
If you open this Loot Box 10 times, Campaign 2 will be completed.  
However, it seems you can only open 5 boxes per day, so it will take at least 2 days.  
The cost to open a box once is 0.000004 ETH.

### Campaign 3

Period: Jan 15 - Feb 12, 07:00 - 07:00 (UTC)

<img width="700" height="315" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6216c439-b069-40ee-a37e-dc0bb3e9712b" />

<img width="646" height="761" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a2f337e-5594-49b7-b522-ef633bef73d9" />

The task is to execute 20 transactions on <https://velodrome.finance/>.  
Each swap counts as 2 transactions, so I completed the task by swapping 0.0001 USDCE to ETH 10 times. （ ´ー｀）y―┛~~

### Campaign 4

Period: Jan 15 - Feb 12, 07:00 - 07:00 (UTC)

<img width="705" height="320" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30981e0f-536d-4b10-b778-e0ef13a0fb58" />

<img width="535" height="552" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae983987-526b-4b16-9289-3c440319ec39" />

I completed this task by going to <https://wowmax.exchange/> and swapping 0.0001 USDCE to ETH 10 times ヽ(´ー`)ノ

### If Your Score Still Isn’t High Enough

If your score is still below 80, you can generate more transactions by doing on-chain GM, participating in Ruby Score voting, and doing Ruby’s daily tasks.  
Keep going until you exceed 80 and get your badge. （ ´ー｀）y―┛~~
