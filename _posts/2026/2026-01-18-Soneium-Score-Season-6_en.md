## How to Complete Soneium Score Season 6 Campaigns

Soneium Score Season 6 has started! 🎉
Soneium Score is a scoring system for activities within Soneium that rewards you with a badge when you exceed 80 points.
To increase your score, you can generate unique transactions, contribute to TVL through LP provision, lending, Vault, etc. However, to efficiently complete Soneium Score, it's most effective to prioritize clearing the season-specific campaigns first.

### Campaign 1

<img width="704" height="308" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bbc5693-d0f0-4071-b933-9b6470619e50" />

Visit <https://www.harkan.io/>, create an account, and spin the Cyber Wheel of Fortune 10 times to complete the task. However, you can only spin 5 times per day, so it will take at least 2 days.

### Campaign 2

Visit <https://surflayer.xyz/?lootbox=1868> and a popup about Loot Box will appear. Open it 10 times to complete Campaign 2. However, you can only open 5 boxes per day, so it will take at least 2 days.
By the way, it costs 0.000004 ETH (approximately $0.15) to open one box.

### Campaign 3

Visit <https://velodrome.finance/> and make 20 transactions. Since one swap counts as 2 transactions, I completed the task by swapping 0.0001 USDCE to ETH 10 times. 😊

### Campaign 4

<img width="705" height="320" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30981e0f-536d-4b10-b778-e0ef13a0fb58" />

Visit <https://wowmax.exchange/> and swap 0.0001 USDCE to ETH 10 times to complete the task. 🎉

### If Your Score Still Isn't Enough
