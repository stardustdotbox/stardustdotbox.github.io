## How to beat the Soneium Score Season 6 campaigns

Soneium Score Season 6 has started ヽ(´ー`)ノ  
Soneium Score is an on-chain activity scoring system on Soneium where you receive a badge once you go over 80 points.  
To increase your score, you need to generate unique transactions, provide LP, do lending, contribute to TVL via vaults, and so on.  
If you want to efficiently beat Soneium Score, the best approach is to clear the seasonal campaigns first and then optimize from there.

### Campaign 1

<img width="704" height="308" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bbc5693-d0f0-4071-b933-9b6470619e50" />

<img width="367" height="464" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8690784-d267-4309-886b-c5f428474444" />

Go to <https://www.harkan.io/>, create an account, and spin the Cyber Wheel of Fortune 10 times to complete the task.  
You can only spin 5 times per day, so it takes at least 2 days.

### Campaign 2

<img width="699" height="313" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95d1a291-4258-46fa-9b04-a4c253f9c4aa" />

<img width="348" height="343" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2625e9f-7fe2-47da-9eaa-838f6b6e2e74" />

<img width="305" height="56" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/623338d3-c1b7-42fa-8f5d-7a3da6d1f3b6" />

When you access <https://surflayer.xyz/?lootbox=1868>, a popup about a Loot Box will appear.  
Open this box 10 times to complete Campaign 2.  
You can only open 5 boxes per day, so again it takes at least 2 days.  
By the way, the cost to open a box once is 0.000004 ETH (about 20 JPY).

### Campaign 3

<img width="700" height="315" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6216c439-b069-40ee-a37e-dc0bb3e9712b" />

<img width="646" height="761" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a2f337e-5594-49b7-b522-ef633bef73d9" />

The task is to record 20 transactions on <https://velodrome.finance/>.  
Since one swap actually records 2 transactions, I completed the task by swapping 0.0001 USDCE to ETH 10 times. （ ´ー｀）y―┛~~

### Campaign 4

<img width="705" height="320" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30981e0f-536d-4b10-b778-e0ef13a0fb58" />

<img width="535" height="552" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae983987-526b-4b16-9289-3c440319ec39" />

For this one, I went to <https://wowmax.exchange/> and swapped 0.0001 USDCE to ETH 10 times to finish the task. ヽ(´ー`)ノ

### If your score is still not enough

If your score is still below 80, keep generating transactions using things like on-chain GM, Ruby Score voting, and Ruby’s daily tasks.  
Keep grinding until you cross 80 points and grab the badge. （ ´ー｀）y―┛~~
