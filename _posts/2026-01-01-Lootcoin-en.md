## Lootcoin Hero Story

In September 2025, a mysterious dApp called [Lootcoin](https://lootcoin.tech?ref=0x53869B88306EB505f0fC66DaE482D42033F85253) was suddenly released on Soneium. It was an enigmatic application where you could purchase your hero for 0.005 ETH and there was only a link to BlackPaper.pdf.

While it's an unspoken rule in the Soneium community that dApps typically come with Discord and other community-building tools, Lootcoin only has X (Twitter) operated by a person named [Lootmoto](https://x.com/Lootcointech) as its sole social media platform.

My hero party currently holds 0.21% of the total mining power and earns 421 $LOOT per day.

I'm enjoying my daily adventures mining Loot, wondering how high the price of Loot will go, or if it won't go up at all.

## BlackPaper.pdf

To learn about [Lootcoin](https://lootcoin.tech?ref=0x53869B88306EB505f0fC66DaE482D42033F85253), you must read the [BlackPaper.pdf](https://lootcoin.tech/blackpaper.pdf).

### 1. Basic Concept

[Lootcoin](https://lootcoin.tech?ref=0x53869B88306EB505f0fC66DaE482D42033F85253) is a token that rebuilds Bitcoin's proven mechanics (fixed supply, decentralized mining, halving schedule) as an **idle RPG-style onchain mining system**. It aims to make Bitcoin's model accessible and understandable to everyone, with the goal of becoming the most recognized coin on Soneium.

### 2. Supply and Halving

- **Fixed Supply**: 21,000,000 $LOOT (same as Bitcoin)
- **Initial Emission**: 2.5 $LOOT per block
- **Halving Interval**: Every 1,050,000 blocks (approximately every 13 days, assuming 1.1-second average block time)
- **Halving Mechanics**: Similar to Bitcoin, block rewards are halved over time

### 3. Onchain Mining System

**Heroes**
- Characters that carry equipment
- Can be added and upgraded using $LOOT
- 24-hour cooldown required before the next addition
- Each hero has the following attributes:
  - **Total Equipment**: Total number of equipment slots
  - **Weight Capacity**: Maximum weight capacity for equipment
  - **Cost**: $LOOT required for upgrade

**Equipment**
- Provides hashpower when equipped to heroes
- Has the following attributes:
  - **Power**: Amount of power provided by the equipment
  - **Weight**: Weight capacity required to wear the equipment
  - **Cost**: $LOOT required to purchase the equipment
- Can be purchased with $LOOT at any time as long as heroes have capacity

**Mining Reward Distribution**
- Rewards are distributed proportionally to each player's share of the total network hashpower
- $LOOT is automatically earned every block

### 4. Burn Mechanics and Referral Rewards

**Burn Mechanics**
- **75% of all miner purchases and facility upgrades are permanently burned**
- Total supply decreases over time, creating deflationary pressure

**Referral Rewards**
- **2.5% of all mined rewards are allocated to the referring address**
- Sustainable incentive for user-driven onboarding

### 5. Initialization and Sybil Attack Prevention

- Players must purchase their initial hero with **a small amount of ETH**
- This prevents Sybil attacks
- Initial hero comes with free equipment, allowing immediate $LOOT mining to begin

### 6. Design Philosophy

[Lootcoin](https://lootcoin.tech?ref=0x53869B88306EB505f0fC66DaE482D42033F85253) aims to provide Bitcoin's mechanics, which are considered "the greatest token mechanics ever created," in a more accessible form for the next generation of users (gamers, creators, investors, and crypto newcomers). Through the idle RPG format, it reconstructs Bitcoin's value proposition as an "adventure and earn" experience.

### Initial Investment and Recovery Potential

**Initial Investment**
- Initial hero purchase: **0.005 ETH (approximately $15-20)**
- This is a relatively low barrier to entry, allowing for risk-controlled investment

**Recovery Potential Analysis**
1. **Early Entry Advantage**
   - Since halving occurs approximately every 13 days, **earlier entry means higher block rewards**
   - Entry before the first halving is most advantageous
   - In the early stages when total network hashpower is low, individual share may be larger

2. **Reward Reduction Speed**
   - Halving occurs approximately every 13 days, which is very frequent
   - Compared to Bitcoin's 4-year halving, reward reduction is **extremely fast**
   - If entry is delayed, rewards decrease exponentially

### Factors Affecting Profitability

**Positive Factors**

1. **Burn Mechanics (75% Burn)**
   - 75% of miner purchases and upgrades are permanently burned
   - Total supply decreases over time, creating **deflationary pressure**
   - Theoretically could contribute to $LOOT value appreciation

2. **Fixed Supply (21M)**
   - Same fixed supply as Bitcoin ensures **scarcity**
   - Potential for long-term value appreciation if the project succeeds

3. **Referral Rewards (2.5%)**
   - Referrers receive 2.5% of mining rewards
   - **Active referral activities can generate additional income**
   - Contributing to community growth indirectly increases project success probability

4. **Accessibility of Idle RPG Format**
   - **Lower barrier to entry** compared to traditional cryptocurrency mining
   - High appeal to gamers, with potential for user base expansion

**Negative Factors and Risks**

1. **Speed of Halving**
   - Halving approximately every 13 days means **very rapid reward reduction**
   - Delayed entry may make initial investment recovery difficult
   - Long-term mining rewards decrease rapidly

2. **Network Hashpower Increase**
   - As more participants join, individual hashpower share **decreases relatively**
   - Since rewards are proportional to total network hashpower, increased competition dilutes rewards

3. **Need for Additional Investment**
   - Hero additions, upgrades, and equipment purchases require **additional $LOOT investment**
   - Not just initial investment, but continuous reinvestment may be necessary
   - 24-hour cooldown limits strategic investment

4. **Project Success Uncertainty**
   - If the project fails, **investment cannot be recovered**
   - Low token liquidity may make selling difficult
   - $LOOT market value heavily depends on project success

5. **Initial Investment Recovery Period**
   - Recovery of initial investment 0.005 ETH (approximately $15-20) depends on **$LOOT value and mining rewards**
   - If $LOOT value is low or rewards are small, recovery may take time or be impossible

### Profitability Scenario Analysis

**Optimistic Scenario**
- Early entry (before first halving)
- Project succeeds and $LOOT value increases
- Additional income from referral rewards
- **Expected Return**: Several to dozens of times initial investment (highly uncertain)

**Realistic Scenario**
- Early to mid-term entry
- Project achieves moderate success
- Combined mining and referral rewards
- **Expected Return**: Recovery to several times initial investment (considering risks)

**Pessimistic Scenario**
- Delayed entry or project failure
- Low mining rewards or low $LOOT value
- **Expected Return**: Difficult recovery or loss

### Conclusion: Is It Profitable?

**Short-term (1-3 months)**
- **Early entrants**: If entered before halving, **recovery possibility is relatively high**
- However, heavily depends on $LOOT value and mining rewards
- **Risk**: Medium

**Mid-term (3-6 months)**
- Several halvings occur, rewards decrease significantly
- Project success determines profitability
- **Risk**: Medium to High

**Long-term (6+ months)**
- Rewards become very small, but burn mechanics may increase value
- If project succeeds, **token value-based returns can be expected**
- **Risk**: High (depends on project success)

**Overall Assessment**

1. **Importance of Early Entry**: Considering halving speed, **entering as early as possible is crucial**
2. **Risk Tolerance**: Initial investment is low, but **loss possibility is significant**
3. **Time Investment**: Even in idle RPG format, **strategic management and continuous involvement are necessary**
4. **Utilizing Referral Rewards**: Maximize additional income opportunities through referral activities
5. **Dependence on Project Success**: Ultimately, **project success determines profitability**

**Recommended Approach**
- Invest initial 0.005 ETH as **money you can afford to lose**
- **Prioritize early entry** (ideally before first halving)
- **Utilize referral rewards** to aim for additional income
- Continuously monitor project developments and **make judgments at appropriate times**
- **Avoid excessive expectations** and treat it as an experimental investment

**Conclusion**: Entry into Lootcoin has the potential for **recovery to several times initial investment with early entry and appropriate strategy**, but **heavily depends on project success and market conditions, with significant loss risk**. Although based on Bitcoin's mechanics, as a new project, **investment should be done carefully, limited to amounts you can afford to lose**.
